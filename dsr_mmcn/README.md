Goal: combine word lattices extracted from multi-microphone captured signals into a Confusion Network
Microphones must be synchronized. A minimum of 3 microphone signal decoding processes are required. 

1) Patch Makefile to incorporate MMCN 
2) Replace lattice.cc into lat/src folder
3) Compile SRiLM
